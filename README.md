# Elitebotix
 Repository for Discord bot Elitebotix

 Open Source as of Mid-January 2023 - If there is any interest in contributing I will add some info on how to set up the bot locally.

Issues are currently still tracked in a private Jira board, there is a mirror to view the issues in the official support [discord server](https://discord.gg/Asz5Gfe) and might be moved to [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/Eliteronix/projects/1) in the future if necessary / useful.
